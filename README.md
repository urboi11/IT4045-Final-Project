# RateMyCourse

### Team Members:

### Project Overview:
University students want to go into new experiences feeling prepared. Currently, there is not an easily accessible way for college students to view ratings for a course. Rate My Professor allows students to see what prior students have said about the course, such as technologies used, example syllabi, how other students thought it related to their majors, etc. As such, we want to develop RateMyCourse to give students an easy way to collect infomration about their courses prior to their semester starting. 

### Goals and Objectives
- To allow students to provide ratings and feedback for courses.
- To provide a searchable catalog of university courses based on course ID.
- To enable students to see comments from previous students about a course.

### Functional Requirements

#### Scenario: Log In
- Given a person is on the login page
- When the user enters a preexisting email and password
- Then they are authenticated and redirected to the website
#### Scenario: Create User
- Given a non-registered user is on the login page
- When they click sign up with their email/password entered
- Then they are added to the database and redirected to the website
#### Scenario: User searches for an existing course
- Given a user is on the home page
- When user searches in the search bar with a course id
- Then a list of possible matches is returned
#### Scenario: User comments on a course
- Given a user has searched and found a course
- When a user types in a comment and clicks "comment"
- Then the comment is posted to the page and to the database
#### Scenario: Create university courses
- Given a user is an admin and is on the profile page
- When the admin fills out the form and clicks "create course"
- Then the course is added to the database and can appear in the search


### StoryBoard
1. This will be the home page that the user will see. They will need to log in to view the courses. They can also sign up to create a new user.

2. Once logged in, the user will see a screen where they can search for classes. The default page(no search) will prompt them to search.

3. Once they serach, some course results will pop up and they can see details about the course as well as previous comments by other students. The user can input a comment on their own about the course as well as provide a rating.

4. If the course number searched doesn't return any results, this is what the user will see.

5. The admin user can then go into the admin profile page to create a course that doesn't exist yet. The admin panel also has other details like courses registered and users registered.

6. The user can also click into their profile to see their details and any comments they've made previously, as well as deleting those comments.

#### com.it4045.finalproject.controllers
WebController: handles the webpages
UserController: endpoint for interacting with courses
CourseController: endpoint for interacting with users

#### com.it4045.finalproject.entities
All entities will use Lombok for getters and setters and other boilerplate methods so they have been excluded from the diagram and description.
User: stores information for the users. isAdmin is a Boolean field which can be set to define a user as an admin and has access to the admin settings page.
Course: stores information for the courses
UserComments: acts as a crossreference table for User and Course.

#### com.it4045.finalproject.services
UserService: implements IUserService
IUserService: interface for user logic. All methods are signature only as is the case for interfaces. Implemented by UserService:
- createUser(): creating a user on signup
- getUserName(): getting the user name
- getUsers(): getting a list of users (for the admin page)
- getCommentsForUser(): getting all the comments a user has made (for the profile page)

CourseService: implements ICourseService
ICourseService: interface for course logic. All methods are signature only as is the case for interfaces. 
Implemented by CourseService.
- createCourse(): creating a course
- searchCourse(): gets a course based on the course ID
- commentOnCourse(): creates a comment based on user input
- deleteComment(): deletes a comment
- getCommentsForCourse(): gets a list of all the comments associated with a course
- getRating(): gets the rating for a given course
- calculateRating(): calculates the new rating based on user input for rating

#### com.it4045.finalproject.data
UserData: implements IUserData
IUserData: interface for interacting with the database, specifically the user table. All methods are signature only as is the case for interfaces.
- createUser(): creates a user in the database
- getUser(): queries the database for a specific user
- getUsers(): gets all the users from the database

CourseData: implements ICourseData
ICourseData: interface for interacting with the database, specifically the course table. All methods are signature only as is the case for interfaces.
- createCourse(): creates a course in the database
- getCourses(): gets a list of all the courses
- getCourse(): gets a specific course based on ID
- updateRating(): updates the rating in the database

UserCommentData: implements IUserCommentData
IUserCommentData: interface for interacting with the database, specifically the usercomment table. All methods are signature only as is the case for interfaces.
- getUserComments(): gets a list of comments for a specific user from database
- getCourseComments(): gets a list of comments for a specific course from database
- deleteUserComment(): deletes a comment based on ID from database
